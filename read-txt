Dear Elisa,

I hope the midterm wasn't too extended. In the beginning I started with some basic data exploration to verify my data somewhat makes sense. I kept it in Nevertheless that
someone can understand my reasoning.
After the plots I wasn't too sure about wheter or not the data is normally distributed. After thinking about it alot I decided to stick with the assumption that
the data isn't normally distributed.
I know we didn't cover Anova but it made sense to use it here IMO.

For the plots I was contemplating alot wheter or not it made sense to use different markers and linestyles. What I wanted to especially highlight is that the gap
during ww1 is perfectly distinguishable between all countries and hence the rather colorful spectrum.


For the pyramid distributions I followed a medium article:

Dear Elisa,

I hope the midterm wasn't too extended. In the beginning I started with some basic data exploration to verify my data somewhat makes sense
After the plots I wasn't too sure about wheter or not the data is normally distributed. After thinking about it alot I decided to stick with the assumption that
the data isn't normally distributed.
I know we didn't cover Anova but it made sense to use it here IMO.

# Life Expectancy with pandas and numpy

## Project Overview

This Jupyter Notebook project is focused on analyzing and visualizing trends in life expectancy data for various countries. By utilizing the powerful data manipulation and analysis libraries, pandas and numpy, this project aims to provide insights into the life expectancy of different countries and summarize the key findings.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following components and sections:

- `Life_Expectancy_Analysis.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook serves as the main project file. It contains the Python code, data analysis, visualization, and interpretations.

- `data/`: This directory stores the dataset(s) used for the analysis. Ensure that you have the required data files in this directory.

- `output/`: This directory can be used to save any output files generated during the analysis, such as visualizations, reports, or data exports.

## Requirements
